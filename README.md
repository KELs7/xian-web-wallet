## Introduction
Xian Connect is a lightweight, serverless web application designed to securely create and manage Xian keypairs using advanced client-side JavaScript. It leverages private key encryption, local storage, and password protection to ensure a high level of security and privacy for users. With Xian Connect, you can easily generate and manage your cryptographic keys without the need for server-side processing or external dependencies.
